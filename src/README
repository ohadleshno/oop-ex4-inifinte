1. Classes in the Package:

FloraGameObject:
Base class for all flora-related game objects (trees, flowers, fruits).
Extends a generic game object class and includes common properties and methods for flora objects.

Tree:
This class represents a tree in the game world.
It includes methods to generate tree trunks and branches and handles the overall structure of a tree.
It can generate flowers and fruits as part of its structure.

Fruit:
Represents a fruit object that can be attached to trees.
Includes properties specific to fruits, such as ripeness.
Handles interactions with other game objects (e.g., being collected by the avatar).

Flora:
This class is responsible for generating and managing flora within a specified range.
It can create trees and manage their placement in the game world.

Flower:
This class represents a flower, a type of flora game object.
It includes specific properties and behaviors for flowers, 
such as their color, size, and response to environmental changes (e.g., wind, player interaction).

2. Connections Between Classes:
Flora class Manages the creation of trees and flowers within a specified range. 
It uses the Tree and Flower classes to create these objects.
Tree class Generates its structure, including trunks, branches, flowers, and fruits. 
It uses the Fruit and Flower classes to create these components.
Fruit and Flower are specific types of flora game objects that can be attached to trees. 
They inherit common behaviors from FloraGameObject.
The handleFruitCollision callback function in the PepseGameManager class is used to manage 
the interactions between the avatar and the fruit objects.
By using the handleFruitCollision function in this way, the collision handling logic is neatly 
encapsulated, making the code easier to manage, extend, and understand.
In addition, the Terrain class provides a public method groundHeightAt(float x) that returns the 
ground height at a specific x-coordinate. This method serves as a clear and simple interface for other 
classes to use without needing to understand the internal workings of the terrain generation.
The Tree class and other classes in the Tree package use this method to determine where trees and plants should be placed.

3. Design Patterns Used:
Factory Pattern: The Flora class acts as a factory for creating trees and their components (flowers and fruits). 
It encapsulates the creation logic and provides a unified interface for generating flora objects.
Composite Pattern: The Tree class uses a composite pattern to manage its components (trunks, branches, flowers, and fruits). 
This allows treating the whole tree structure as a single object while managing its parts individually.
Observer Pattern: The Flower class uses scheduled tasks and transitions 
to respond to environmental changes and player interactions. 
These scheduled tasks act as observers that trigger specific behaviors at predefined times.
